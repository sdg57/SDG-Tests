There’s more to this story so grand,  \\nAs the function unwinds, like grains of fine sand.  \\nEach step a reminder of paths we have tread,  \\nReconstructing the answers, with wisdom well-fed.  \\n\\nFibonacci’s numbers, in nature they twine,  \\nA recursive descent, a growth so divine.  \\nFrom zero to one, two follows the dance,  \\nEach call builds upon with a magical chance.  \\n\\nBut beware the deep woods, where infinite lies,  \\nFor without a good base, your function may rise,  \\nInto endless recursion, a stack frame’s regret,  \\nA crash on the shores of a logic upset.  \\n\\nSo harness this power, let it guide your way,  \\nTo solve complex puzzles, both night and day.  \\nWith a flick of the mind, and a recursive embrace,  \\nYou’ll craft wondrous programs, a coder’s true grace.  \\n\\nIn this dance of the intellect, elegant and neat,  \\nRecursion, my friend, is a rhythm so sweet.  \\nA cycle of calls, a beautiful feat,  \\nIn the heart of our code, where all functions meet.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"
